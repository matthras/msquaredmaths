	<h1>Complex Numbers</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<h3>Number Sets</h3>

			When we work with numbers, we typically work with real numbers, integers (or natural numbers), and occasionally irrational numbers.

			Complex numbers are a set of numbers that contain the set of real numbers (and consequently every other set of numbers contained within the set of real numbers). We can visualise how these sets interact with each other as below.

			<h3>What is a complex number?</h3>

			A complex number is a number that takes the form \( a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers, and \( i \)* is a unit that is equal to to the square root of -1. That is, \[ i = \sqrt{-1}. \]

			For brevity and by convention, we denote an arbitrary complex number as \( z \).

			*In some physics and engineering disciplines, the complex unit is denoted \( j \) to avoid conflict with other variables sharing the same letter.
