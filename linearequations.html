<h1>Linear Equations</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

A linear equation is an equation depicting a straight line, and is commonly written in the form \( y = mx + c. \)* This is known as the gradient-intercept form.<!-- gradient-intercept form? -->

Examples of linear equations are: <!-- Insert 4 diagrams: 1 passing through the origin, one horizontal line, one vertical line, one negative slope -->

*Linear equations can also be written in the form \( ax+by+c = 0 \) which can be converted to gradient-intercept form by rearranging the equation. This is left as an exercise to the reader.

<h2>Drawing/Sketching A Linear Equation</h2>

In order to sketch a linear equation, we need to find the co-ordinates of two points that satisfy this equation. The easiest way to do this is to find the x-intercept and the y-intercept, which is demonstrated as follows.

Let's say we want to sketch the equation \( y=2x+1 \). 

The x-intercept is the value of x when y = 0, so in order to find the x-intercept, we substitute y = 0 into our equation. \[ 0 = 2x + 1 \\ 2x + 1 = 0 \\ 2x = -1 \\ x = -\frac{1}{2}. \]
This gives us the co-ordinate \( (-\frac{1}{2}, 0) \).

The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0, so in order to find the y-intercept, we substitute x = 0 into our equation. \[ y = (2*0) + 1 \\ y = 1. \]
This gives us the co-ordinate \( (0,1) \).

We can then plot these co-ordinates on a graph, and then draw a line going through both of these points.

<h2>Finding The Equation of A Linear Graph</h2>

Some information is required before we are able to determine the equation of a linear graph. We can find the equation of a linear graph using:

<ul>
	<li>co-ordinates of any two different point (where either one or both of them can be the y-intercept and/or x-intercept).</li>
	<li>the gradient of the function and the co-ordinates of apoint on the function (which can be the x-intercept or the y-intercept)</li>
</ul>
