<h1>Injective (one-to-one) and Surjective (onto) Functions</h1>

When investigating functions, we are often interested in their properties which allow us to determine additional factors and/or capabilities of such functions. 

As a side-note to seasoned mathematicians, we will look at injectivity and surjectivity in context of graphs/diagrams as it is a familiar medium to most students.

<h2>Injective (one-to-one) Functions</h2>

<h3>The Layman's Definition</h3>

The easiest way to remember the definition of an injective (or one-to-one) function, as it is taught in a non-rigourous way, is as follows:

Definition (Layman)

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is injective (or one-to-one) if it passes the horizontal line/ruler test.

If you are new to this idea, the horizontal line/ruler test is as follows: Slide a ruler or horizontal line along the graph. If it touches more than one point on the graph, the function is not injective. 

The following are examples of injective and non-injective functions:

<!-- Insert diagrams with equations here -->

<!-- Insert applet for testing? -->


<h3>The Mathematical Definition</h3>

If you care to read on, what I want to do now is to introduce to you the mathematical definition of an injective function, and then from there, work towards the layman's definition initially introduced.

Definition (Mathematical)

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is injective (or one-to-one) where for some \( a, b \in X \): if \( f(a) = f(b) \), then \( a = b \).

At first glance this seems like a very odd and untuitive definition, but it's a little easier to understand if we recognise that we can simply write \( (x,y) \) co-ordinates as \( (x, f(x)) \). For some, the following definition may be easier to understand:

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is injective (or one-to-one) where for some \( x_1, x_2 \in X\), \( y_1, y_2 \in Y \), where \( f(x_1) = y_1 \) and \( f(x_2) = y_2 \) : if \( y_1 = y_2 \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \).

where it is assumed that we are working with any two given co-ordinates \( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \).

Let's simply this a little further. 

A function \( f: X \to Y \) is injective (or one-to-one) where if two \(y\)-values are the same, then their corresponding \(x\) values are the same.
